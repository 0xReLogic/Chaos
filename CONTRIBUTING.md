**Testing Checklist for Contributors:**
- [ ] `test_ultimate_scaling.py` runs without errors

- [ ] Code works with both NumPy (CPU) and CuPy (GPU) if applicable

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

-   Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
-   Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
-   Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
-   Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### Python Styleguide

All Python code must adhere to [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). We use `black` for auto-formatting.

**CHAOS-Specific Guidelines:**
- **Performance-Critical Code**: Use NumPy/CuPy best practices for large array operations
- **Memory Efficiency**: Avoid matrix construction for quantum gates; prefer direct state manipulation
- **Documentation**: Include complexity analysis for algorithms (e.g., O(2^n) memory, O(nÂ²) time)
- **GPU Compatibility**: Ensure new features work with both NumPy (CPU) and CuPy (GPU) backends

```python
# Good: Direct state manipulation (memory efficient)
from math import sqrt

def apply_hadamard_direct(state_vector, qubit_index, total_qubits):
    """Apply Hadamard gate directly to state vector (O(2^n) memory, O(2^n) time)"""
    step = 2 ** qubit_index
    for i in range(0, len(state_vector), 2 * step):
        for j in range(step):
            a = state_vector[i + j]
            b = state_vector[i + j + step]
            state_vector[i + j] = (a + b) / sqrt(2)
            state_vector[i + j + step] = (a - b) / sqrt(2)

# Avoid: Matrix construction (memory explosion - O(4^n) memory!)
# full_matrix = np.kron(I, np.kron(H, I))  # Don't do this for large circuits
# This would need 64GB+ for just 15 qubits!
```

We appreciate your contributions!

python -c "
import tracemalloc
tracemalloc.start()
from quantum_circuit import QuantumCircuit
qc = QuantumCircuit(20)
qc.apply_hadamard_to_all()  # Worst case for memory
qc.run()
current, peak = tracemalloc.get_traced_memory()
print(f'Peak memory: {peak / 1024**2:.1f} MB (should be < 100MB)')
tracemalloc.stop()
"

# GPU Compatibility Test
python -c "
try:
    import cupy as cp
    from quantum_circuit import QuantumCircuit
    qc = QuantumCircuit(15)  # Test reasonable size
    qc.apply_hadamard_to_all()
    qc.run()
    print('GPU acceleration working')
except ImportError:
    print('GPU acceleration not available (optional)')
except Exception as e:
    print(f'GPU test failed: {e}')
"

# Performance Regression Test
python -c "
import time
from quantum_circuit import QuantumCircuit
start = time.time()
qc = QuantumCircuit(18)
qc.apply_qft()  # Standard benchmark
qc.run()
elapsed = time.time() - start
print(f'18-qubit QFT: {elapsed:.2f}s (baseline: ~30s on CPU, ~5s on GPU)')
"
```
